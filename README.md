### Instruction:
Upload the dataset folder "chest_xray" in your drive and change the path in the code "Deep Learning Based Pneumonia Detection".

### Project Title:
Deep Learning Based Pneumonia Detection.

### Description:
This work mainly focuses on the use of machine learning algorithms to analyze chest radiographs to improve decision-making and reach the correct diagnosis. These models aim to help with the classification problem of determining whether there are pneumonia-related abnormalities in the chest x-ray and classifying these x-rays into two categories according to the detection results.

### Dataset:
The dataset consists of 5856 chest X-ray images in JPEG format that are organized into three folders: train, test, and val. Each of these files
has two subfolders that each include pictures of pneumonia
affected or healthy people.

### Model:
Convolutional neural networks, VGG16, ResNet-50, and
InceptionNet deep learning models are used.

### Result:
The highest level of accuracy is 96.00 percent for ResNet-50 model and Inception Net model.

### Language:
Python

### IDE:
Google Colab
